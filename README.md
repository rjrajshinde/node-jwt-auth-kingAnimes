#main part 
In this code we used jsonwebtoken to perform authentication

here we created a token for every user that's going to sign up on our website and send this token with the 
help of cookie to browser for authentication purpose
when the user logout the token will be deleted from browser cookies and user can't access this page without login

for sending data to database we used routes and script also

I created this project with the help of some tutorials
